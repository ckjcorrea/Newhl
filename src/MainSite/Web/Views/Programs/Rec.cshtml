 <!--          <h3>Recreational Level</h3>
            <hr>--> 
            <p>Our recreational level players participate in a skills-based program where the coach will build on the skating skills that you already have developed, work on more puck-handling skills, and add elements such as playing positions and making plays such as breakouts, face-offs, and offensive plays. We will end the season with the goal of putting a skilled Recreational/D level team in our annual April Showers Tournament.
                <br />To join one of the recreational programs, you must demonstrate intermediate skating skills and some hockey experience. If you are starting out with NEWHL this season, you will be required to start in our Learn to Play. If you advance quickly, and the coach believes that you would be better off skating in the Recreational/D level, you will be able to move directly into this program.
            </p>
            <p>The Shooting and Stick Handling session is also available to Recreational level players and is held on Thursdays, 9:30 am - 11:00 am.
                <br />This skills program is designed for players who are serious about taking their Shooting & Stickhandling abilities to the next level. Players will be instructed and shown good technique, going through quality repetitions and being provided with positive feedback thus enhancing their ability to succeed.<a href="#Details"> Program details are below.</a>
